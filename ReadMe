A blockchain is a widely-used data structure, particularly in applications such as cryptocurrencies. It consists of a series of blocks, each containing specific data and a hash of the previous block. This chaining of blocks ensures data integrity; altering the data in one block changes its hash, causing a mismatch with the subsequent block's stored hash. Consequently, tampering with a block's data requires altering all subsequent blocks, making it a computationally difficult task.
